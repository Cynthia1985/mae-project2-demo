# mae-project2-demo - Art & Entertainment Journal


## Concept

A blog/journal specifically to keep track of recent movies you’ve watched, books you've read, and albums you've recently enjoyed. (God knows we’re all consuming more of these right now while quarantining.) 

## Technologies Used

- JSX
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- React
- JavaScript

## Structure

As noted, the application has three different models and sets of routes:

- Movies
- Books
- Albums

Users can log recently recently consumed entertainment in their respective categories. Each has their own item details to be added. Movies for example include:

- Title
- Genre
- Year Released
- Date Watched
- Where the movie was viewed - theater, or which platform/streaming service
- Rating, on a scale of 1-5
- A written review

Users are asked to copy and paste in a URL of the movie poster, or book or album cover to serve as avatars in the show galleries. 

The app has the functionality to edit each entry, or to delete the entry entirely. 

## Challenges

Initial hurdle was bringing all three apps together on the landing page, and giving each category their own set of routes. The biggest struggle in this part of the process was simply making several syntax errors and mislabeling. 

Once those issues were resolved, my focus went to styling - where I hoped to spend the majority of the time on this project. I used both flex and grid elements to style the individual pages and image galleries.

## What I Would Like to Revisit

- I would to continue to tweak the design overall.

- Making the page responsive for tablet and mobile.

- The index page of each category has a movie quote, book quote, or song lyric. My initial idea was to have arrays of quotes that would be randomly generated each time the pages are reloaded.

- Of course, movies, books and albums covers a lot of ground, but other categories could be added, such as television series, or live shows. (I mean, not at this present moment, but...)
